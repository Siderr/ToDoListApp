# ToDoListApp
Simple TODO Application using Node.js back end and React.JS front end

To run back end you must have Node.js installed. Also, you need to run "npm install" to install all the node modules needed. Then locate server.js file in the "Backend" folder and run "node server.js".
Configure APACHE to load index.html. Last thing, you will need to have a working MongoDB installed. Have fun!
